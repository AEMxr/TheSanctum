# Mission Control

## North Star
Build a sovereign, revenue-supporting Noura ecosystem while preserving release-gate baseline invariants.

## Active Objectives
Only three execution lanes are active:
1. Control Plane: release-gate stability and auditability.
2. Revenue Plane: monetizable automations behind safe flags.
3. Learning Plane: eval-backed quality improvements.

## Priority Rule
1. Every task must map to exactly one objective lane.
2. Tasks not mapped to an objective lane are blocked from execution.

## Baseline Anchors
1. `release-gate-baseline-v2.4.0`
2. `release-gate-postfreeze-clean-v2.4.0`

## Current Accepted Feature Anchor
- Phase 1 scaffold commit (if present): `7f59cfd0ee33972d3f6a1be87e49b981d0afeb8a`
