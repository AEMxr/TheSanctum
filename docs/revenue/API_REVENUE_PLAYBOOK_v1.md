# API Revenue Playbook v1

## Purpose
Operationalize a weekly API factory that converts shipped API capabilities into repeatable monetization offers.

## Weekly Cadence (1 API/week Rule)
1. Select one API capability candidate for the week.
2. Package the capability into a clear offer tier set.
3. Run outreach and pilot activation.
4. Collect conversion and retention signals.
5. Decide: iterate, expand, or retire.

## Offer Template (Free/Pro/Overage)
1. Free tier:
   - Limited calls and basic SLA.
   - Intended for trial and integration validation.
2. Pro tier:
   - Higher call quota, priority support, stronger SLA.
   - Intended for active production usage.
3. Overage:
   - Per-unit usage cost above plan limits.
   - Explicit hard cap and alert thresholds to prevent surprise spend.

## First 3 Paying Users Process
1. Identify target segment and pain point mapped to weekly API.
2. Prepare concise value pitch and onboarding checklist.
3. Run controlled pilot with explicit success criteria.
4. Convert first paying user with documented objections and resolution.
5. Repeat for users two and three with template refinements.
6. Capture reusable sales and onboarding assets after each conversion.

## KPI Progression Thresholds
1. Activation:
   - Target pilot activation rate >= 30% of qualified leads.
2. Conversion:
   - Target paid conversion >= 10% of activated pilots.
3. Retention:
   - Target week-4 retention >= 70% of converted accounts.
4. Economics:
   - Target positive unit margin at Pro + Overage blend.

## Progression Decision Rules
1. Promote to broader rollout only when KPI thresholds are met.
2. Iterate pricing/packaging when activation is high but conversion is low.
3. Retire weekly offer when repeated cycles fail retention/economics targets.

## Governance Link
This playbook is the revenue-plane execution standard for weekly API monetization milestones.
