# Zip Audit Playbook

## Deterministic Audit Protocol
1. Inventory the project tree.
2. Locate mission, non-negotiables, roadmap, and task cards.
3. Check baseline invariants (release-gate semantics anchors).
4. Map current repo state to active objective lane(s).
5. Produce a Drift Report:
   - In-alignment items
   - Drift items
   - Blockers
   - Recommended next 1-3 tasks only
6. Output an acceptance-gated action plan.

## Required Audit Output Format
1. State Summary
2. Drift Findings
3. Risk Level
4. Next Task Card Drafts
